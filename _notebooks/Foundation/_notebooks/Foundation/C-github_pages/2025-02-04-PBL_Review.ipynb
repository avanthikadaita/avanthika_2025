    "- Engaged in both frontend and backend development\n",
    "- Effective problem-solving in adding event handling, modal interactions, and data organization\n",
    "- Attention to user experience, evident in my N@tM feedback and improvements in event reminders\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Weaknesses:**  \n",
    "- Improving visualization techniques such as DrawIO, could enhance documentation clarity\n",
    "- Improving the amount of time it's taking me to code and analyze code faster \n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps and Project Plans**\n",
    "- **Enhancing UI/UX further**: Implementing additional feedback improvements to make event handling more intuitive\n",
    "- **Refining backend logic**: Strengthening API responses and error handling based on the issues identified\n",
    "- **Collaborating more actively**: Talking to other students to explain thhe calendar more in detail to expain how it functions\n",

    "5/5 - I documented the key activities I participated in during the 12 weeks, including frontend/backend issues, personal burndown, team teach FRQ, analytics for both frontend and backend, and my personal blog. I should work more on my blog and keeping it up to date. Especially with the team teaches that we did, as this will help me prepare for the AP Exam.\n",

    "1.8/2 points - Full Stack Feature Demo, include highlighting Java and N@tM feedback\n",
    "I included a detailed demonstration of the full-stack feature with images showing the reminders sidebar, event handling, and styling.\n",
    "I also included feedback from N@tM, which helped improve error handling in Slack. However, it would have been a better idea if we had created a feedback form for people to fill out with their input during N@TM\n",
    "\n",
    "0.8/1 point - I wrote a clear and concise blog post explaining the key features of the reminders functionality, including how users can add, edit, and delete events. I also included explanations of modal behavior. However, a better visualization would have been better\n",
    "\n",
    "1/1 - I completed all the MCQ and FRQs that were posted on college board"

    "\n",
    "In terms of collaboration, I contributed to team discussions and retrospectives, but I could have done more to directly communicate with my team as we are in different classes. My N@TM feedback focused on making the project more user-friendly, like adding error messages, auto-formatting, and better feedback suggestions.\n",

    "Looking ahead, I want to continue learning full-stack development, improve my collaboration and communication skills, and explore opportunities like internships or coding competitions. I also plan to work on better visualizing my ideas using tools like DrawIO or Mermaid to improve my project presentations."
