    "## üóìÔ∏è Calendar Project: Full Feature Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. üìÖ Calendar UI & Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Integrated FullCalendar**: Utilized FullCalendar (v5.11.0) for interactive monthly, weekly, and daily views.\n",
    "- **Responsive Design**: Applied custom CSS and Tailwind to make the calendar mobile-friendly with a sleek, modern interface.\n",
    "- **Custom Toolbar Buttons**: Added filter buttons (`All`, `CSA`, `CSP`, `CSSE`) with unique colors, hover states, and active styles for better navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. üîÑ Event Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Integration**:\n",
    "  - Fetched calendar events from `/api/calendar/events`\n",
    "  - Pulled assignment data from `/api/assignments/`\n",
    "- **Error Handling**:\n",
    "  - Logged HTTP errors and fetch exceptions to the console\n",
    "  - Alerted users on failed `add`, `edit`, or `delete` operations\n",
    "- **Event Parsing**:\n",
    "  - Normalized raw event data\n",
    "  - Assigned colors based on type (`CSA`, `CSP`, `CSSE`, `assignments`)\n",
    "  - Handled flexible date formatting for assignment entries\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. üîç Event Filtering & Display\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Global Event Array**: Used an `allEvents` array to store and manage all calendar data.\n",
    "- **Class Filtering**: Implemented `filterEventsByClass` to toggle event visibility by course type.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Rendering**: Destroyed and re-rendered the calendar on every filter change or data update.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. ‚úèÔ∏è Event Modal & CRUD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modal UI**:\n",
    "  - Displayed full event details on click\n",
    "  - Enabled `edit` and `delete` on existing events\n",
    "  - Allowed adding new events via date click\n",
    "- **Add Event**:\n",
    "  - Opened modal with empty form\n",
    "  - Sent `POST` to `/api/calendar/add_event`\n",
    "  - Re-fetched and refreshed UI on success\n",
    "- **Edit Event**:\n",
    "  - Enabled form editing\n",
    "  - Sent `PUT` to `/api/calendar/edit/{id}`\n",
    "  - Updated event on the calendar after success\n",
    "- **Delete Event**:\n",
    "  - Showed confirmation prompt\n",
    "  - Sent `DELETE` to `/api/calendar/delete/{id}`\n",
    "  - Removed event from UI immediately after success\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. üöÄ UX Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Allowed users to close modals using the Escape key.\n",
    "- **Click Outside to Close**: Automatically closed modals when clicking outside of them.\n",
    "- **Tooltips**: Displayed event info on hover using styled tooltips.\n",
    "- **Slack Formatting Support**:\n",
    "  - Parsed Slack-style markup (bold, italics, strikethrough, inline code, links)\n",
    "  - Converted it safely to clean HTML\n",
    "  - Handled both inline and block code gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. üß∞ Utility Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Date Formatting**:\n",
    "  - `formatDate()` for converting to ISO format\n",
    "  - `formatDisplayDate()` for human-friendly date display\n",
    "- **HTML Escaping**: Prevented XSS by safely rendering descriptions.\n",
    "- **Slack-to-HTML Converter**: Built a custom parser to handle all supported Slack formatting types.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. üß± General Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Code**: Kept logic clean and organized by splitting into reusable functions (fetching, rendering, modals, formatting).\n",
    "- **Modern JavaScript**: Used ES6+ syntax and best practices for clean, efficient code.\n",
    "- **Backend Integration**: Connected to a Java backend for reliable event storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß† Calendar Feature Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. üóÇÔ∏è Entity: `CalendarEvent`\n",
    "\n",
    "Represents a calendar event stored in the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Annotated with `@Entity`, mapped to the `calendar_events` table.\n",
    "- **Fields:**\n",
    "  - `id`: Primary key, auto-generated.\n",
    "  - `date`: The date of the event (`LocalDate`).\n",
    "  - `title`: Title of the event.\n",
    "  - `description`: Description/details of the event.\n",
    "  - `type`: Type/category of the event (e.g., meeting, exam).\n",
    "  - `period`: Period or time slot (e.g., \"Period 1\", \"Period 3\").\n",
    "- Includes constructors, getters, and setters for all fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. üì¶ Repository: `CalendarEventRepository`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interface for CRUD operations on `CalendarEvent` entities.\n",
    "- Likely extends `JpaRepository<CalendarEvent, Long>`.\n",
    "- Used by the service layer to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. üß∞ Service: `CalendarEventService`\n",
    "\n",
    "Contains business logic for calendar events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Responsibilities:**\n",
    "  - Creating, updating, and deleting events.\n",
    "  - Fetching events by date, type, or period.\n",
    "  - Validating event data before saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. üåê Controller: `CalendarEventController`\n",
    "\n",
    "Handles HTTP requests related to calendar events.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Endpoints:**\n",
    "  - `GET /calendar/events`: List all events.\n",
    "  - `POST /calendar/events`: Create a new event.\n",
    "  - `PUT /calendar/events/{id}`: Update an event.\n",
    "  - `DELETE /calendar/events/{id}`: Delete an event.\n",
    "- Uses `CalendarEventService` to process requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. üîó Slack Integration (Contextual)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The calendar module exists under the `slack` package, suggesting possible integration with Slack.\n",
    "- May be used for:\n",
    "  - Posting event reminders or notifications.\n",
    "  - Slack-related files (`SlackController`, `SlackService`, etc.) possibly interact with calendar events for messaging and alerts.\n"
