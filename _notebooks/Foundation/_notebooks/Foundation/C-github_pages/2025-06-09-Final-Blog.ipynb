    "# Final Interview  \n",
    "10 Jun 2025 • Project Work\n",
    "\n",
    "## About Me  \n",
    "I am a high school junior with a strong interest in computer science, mathematics, and full-stack development. I am particularly drawn to the ways in which technology can be applied to improve user experience, streamline workflows, and create scalable solutions to real-world problems. My primary focus has been developing technical depth in backend systems, API integration, and frontend design.\n",
    "\n",
    "I enjoy working across the stack and have built projects involving Java, JavaScript, Spring Boot, and API development. I am always seeking opportunities to improve my technical and collaborative skills through team-based projects and independent development work.\n",

    "## Project Overview  \n",
    "### Calendar Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The Calendar project is a full-stack scheduling and event-management system developed to support student planning and organization. It integrates a user-friendly interface with robust backend support, offering dynamic event filtering and CRUD functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Features  \n",
    "- **Frontend:**  \n",
    "  - Implemented using FullCalendar (v5.11.0) with custom Tailwind CSS and JavaScript.  \n",
    "  - Toolbar filters by class type (CSA, CSP, CSSE) with dynamic view updates.  \n",
    "  - Responsive and accessible design for mobile and desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Backend:**  \n",
    "  - Built with Spring Boot and Java.  \n",
    "  - Calendar events persist in a relational database via a `CalendarEvent` entity managed through `CalendarEventRepository`.  \n",
    "  - `CalendarEventService` handles business logic and validation.  \n",
    "  - RESTful endpoints exposed via `CalendarEventController`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Functionality:**  \n",
    "  - Full CRUD operations with modals for viewing, editing, and deleting events.  \n",
    "  - API integration with assignment data and custom Slack-style formatting for event descriptions.  \n",
    "  - Filtering system maintains performance and usability as event volume scales.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Highlights  \n",
    "- Custom Slack-to-HTML parser supporting bold, italics, strikethrough, inline code, and links.  \n",
    "- Utility functions for secure formatting and XSS prevention.  \n",
    "- Modular codebase adhering to ES6+ standards with clean separation of concerns.  \n",
    "\n",

    "## Data Structures & Certification of Articulation Success\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the academic year, I completed all major homework assignments for AP Computer Science A, demonstrating understanding and application of core data structure and algorithm concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homework Summary  \n",
    "- **Unit 1:** Primitive types, arithmetic operations, and variable scope.  \n",
    "- **Unit 2:** Object creation, constructors, methods, and reference types.  \n",
    "- **Unit 3:** Boolean expressions, control flow, and conditionals.  \n",
    "- **Unit 4:** Iteration with for, while, and nested loops.  \n",
    "- **Unit 5:** Class design, encapsulation, and instance variables.  \n",
    "- **Unit 6:** Arrays and basic array algorithms.  \n",
    "- **Unit 7:** ArrayLists, dynamic memory usage, and filtering.  \n",
    "- **Unit 8:** 2D arrays and grid traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homework artifacts are organized and available on the [Homework Page](#).\n",

    "## Project Showcase\n",
    "\n",
    "### Night at the Museum – June 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "During Night at the Museum, I presented the Calendar Project to peers, teachers, and guests. This event provided valuable feedback and insights that I used to identify areas for future improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways  \n",
    "- Identified the need for performance optimization as event data scales.  \n",
    "- Discovered that some features, such as event editing and Slack formatting, require additional user guidance.  \n",
    "- Received suggestions for expanding functionality to include recurring events and push notifications.  \n",
    "- Engaged with users to explore how this tool could be adapted for broader use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Improvements  \n",
    "- Optimize calendar rendering with incremental updates or virtualization.  \n",
    "- Add drag-and-drop support for rescheduling events.  \n",
    "- Improve accessibility with screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation.  \n",
    "- Implement authentication to support user-specific event management.  \n",
    "- Add recurring event logic and enhanced notification systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
