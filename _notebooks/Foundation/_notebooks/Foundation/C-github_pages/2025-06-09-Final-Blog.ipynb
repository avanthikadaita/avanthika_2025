    "## Calendar Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Calendar Project** is a full-stack scheduling and event-management system designed to help students plan and organize efficiently. It combines an intuitive interface with a powerful backend, featuring dynamic event filtering and full CRUD capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Frontend:**  \n",
    "- Built with **FullCalendar v5.11.0**, styled using **Tailwind CSS** and vanilla JavaScript.  \n",
    "- Toolbar filters allow event categorization by class type (CSA, CSP, CSSE) with dynamic calendar updates.  \n",
    "- Fully responsive and accessible, optimized for both mobile and desktop.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backend:**  \n",
    "- Developed using **Spring Boot** and **Java**.  \n",
    "- Persistent event storage with `CalendarEvent` entities managed via `CalendarEventRepository`.  \n",
    "- Business logic and validation handled by `CalendarEventService`.  \n",
    "- RESTful API endpoints exposed through `CalendarEventController`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functionality:**  \n",
    "- Complete **CRUD operations** supported via modal dialogs for event viewing, editing, and deletion.  \n",
    "- Integration with assignment APIs and custom Slack-style formatting for event descriptions.  \n",
    "- Efficient filtering system ensures smooth performance at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Highlights  \n",
    "- Custom **Slack-to-HTML parser** supporting formatting like bold, italics, strikethrough, inline code, and hyperlinks.  \n",
    "- Security-conscious design with utilities for formatting and XSS prevention.  \n",
    "- Modular ES6+ codebase emphasizing separation of concerns and maintainability.\n",
