    "## Calendar Project: Full Feature Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Calendar UI & Styling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrated FullCalendar (v5.11.0) for interactive monthly, weekly, and daily views.\n",
    "- Applied custom CSS and Tailwind for a responsive, modern, mobile-friendly interface.\n",
    "- Added custom toolbar buttons (`All`, `CSA`, `CSP`, `CSSE`) with distinct colors, hover states, and active styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Event Data Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "- API Integration:\n",
    "  - Fetched calendar events from `/api/calendar/events`.\n",
    "  - Pulled assignment data from `/api/assignments/`.\n",
    "- Error Handling:\n",
    "  - Logged HTTP errors and fetch exceptions.\n",
    "  - Alerted users on failed add, edit, or delete operations.\n",
    "- Event Parsing:\n",
    "  - Normalized event data.\n",
    "  - Assigned colors based on type (`CSA`, `CSP`, `CSSE`, assignments).\n",
    "  - Handled flexible date formatting for assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Event Filtering & Display\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintained a global `allEvents` array to manage calendar data.\n",
    "- Implemented `filterEventsByClass` to toggle event visibility by course type.\n",
    "- Destroyed and re-rendered the calendar on filter changes or data updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Event Modal & CRUD Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modal UI:\n",

    "  - Allowed editing and deleting existing events.\n",
    "  - Enabled adding new events via date click.\n",
    "- Add Event:\n",
    "  - Opened modal with empty form.\n",
    "  - Sent POST requests to `/api/calendar/add_event`.\n",
    "  - Refreshed UI on success.\n",
    "- Edit Event:\n",
    "  - Enabled form editing.\n",
    "  - Sent PUT requests to `/api/calendar/edit/{id}`.\n",
    "  - Updated events on success.\n",
    "- Delete Event:\n",
    "  - Confirmed deletion.\n",
    "  - Sent DELETE requests to `/api/calendar/delete/{id}`.\n",
    "  - Removed events from UI on success.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. UX Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keyboard shortcuts for closing modals with the Escape key.\n",
    "- Closing modals when clicking outside of them.\n",
    "- Tooltips to display event details on hover.\n",
    "- Slack formatting support:\n",
    "  - Parsed Slack-style markup (bold, italics, strikethrough, inline code, links).\n",
    "  - Safely converted Slack formatting to HTML.\n",
    "  - Handled both inline and block code elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Utility Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Date formatting functions:\n",
    "  - `formatDate()` for ISO strings.\n",
    "  - `formatDisplayDate()` for readable dates.\n",
    "- HTML escaping to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.\n",
    "- Custom Slack-to-HTML converter for markup parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. General Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modular functions separating fetching, rendering, modal logic, and formatting.\n",
    "- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) best practices.\n",
    "- Integrated with a Java backend for persistent event storage and retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Calendar Feature Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Entity: `CalendarEvent`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Represents a calendar event stored in the database.\n",
    "- Annotated with `@Entity`, mapped to the `calendar_events` table.\n",
    "- Fields:\n",
    "  - `id`: Primary key, auto-generated.\n",
    "  - `date`: The date of the event (`LocalDate`).\n",
    "  - `title`: Title of the event.\n",
    "  - `description`: Description/details.\n",
    "  - `type`: Type or category (e.g., meeting, exam).\n",
    "  - `period`: Period or time slot (e.g., \"Period 1\").\n",
    "- Includes constructors, getters, and setters for all fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Repository: `CalendarEventRepository`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interface for CRUD operations on `CalendarEvent` entities.\n",
    "- Likely extends `JpaRepository<CalendarEvent, Long>`.\n",
    "- Used by the service layer to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Service: `CalendarEventService`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contains business logic for calendar events.\n",
    "- Responsibilities:\n",
    "  - Creating, updating, deleting events.\n",
    "  - Fetching events by date, type, or period.\n",
    "  - Validating event data before saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Controller: `CalendarEventController`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handles HTTP requests related to calendar events.\n",
    "- Typical endpoints:\n",
    "  - `GET /calendar/events`: List all events.\n",
    "  - `POST /calendar/events`: Create a new event.\n",
    "  - `PUT /calendar/events/{id}`: Update an event.\n",
    "  - `DELETE /calendar/events/{id}`: Delete an event.\n",
    "- Uses `CalendarEventService` to process requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Slack Integration (Contextual)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The calendar module exists under the `slack` package, indicating possible integration with Slack.\n",
    "- May be used for:\n",
    "  - Posting event reminders or notifications.\n",
    "  - Interacting with Slack via related classes (`SlackController`, `SlackService`).\n",

    "### N@TM Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "During development, I realized that while the calendar’s core features are solid and user-friendly, there are opportunities to improve both functionality and user experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization:** As event volume grows, re-rendering the entire calendar on every filter or update could cause lag. Implementing incremental updates or virtualization would improve responsiveness.\n",
    "- **Advanced Notifications:** Integrating push notifications or email reminders could enhance the calendar’s usefulness.\n",
    "- **Recurring Events:** Currently, the system handles only single-instance events. Adding support for recurring events would address a common use case.\n",
    "- **Drag and Drop Support:** Enabling drag-and-drop event rescheduling within the calendar UI would improve user interaction and flexibility.\n",
    "- **Accessibility Enhancements:** While the calendar is responsive, further accessibility improvements (keyboard navigation, screen reader support) would broaden usability.\n",
    "- **User Accounts and Permissions:** Adding user authentication and event ownership could personalize the experience and improve security.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, I plan to explore these enhancements, focusing first on performance improvements and recurring event support. Overall, this project strengthened my skills in full-stack development, UI/UX design, and API integration, and I look forward to building on this foundation.\n"
